This contains a string value, depending on what you just hit. You can see below the possible string values that `type` can contain.\n\nYou can treat this as if it were a variable.\n\n**Hint:** when testing a string condition, you will use \n\n```javascript\nif (type == 'wall') {\n  showMessage('You hit a wall')\n}\n```\n\nHere are the possible values that `type` can have.\n\n| Types |\n| :- |\n| wall |\n| monster |\n| energy |\n| goal |\n",

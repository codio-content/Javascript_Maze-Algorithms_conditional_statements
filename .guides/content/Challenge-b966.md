Now let's put our new conditional tests to use. 

|||challenge
## Not Equal
Inside the stepsTaken() event handler, write some code that checks "if energy is not 0, show the message 'You're still alive' otherwise say 'You've run out of energy' and kill the player with `killPlayer()`.

Test it out in the game first.

{check it!! | custom}(test-neq)
|||

|||challenge
##  Less and Greater
Inside the stepsTaken() event handler, write some code that checks 

- "if energy is less than 10, show the message "You're running out of energy".
- "if energy is greater than or equal to 30 show the message "You've got bags of energy".
- Otherwise show "You're doing ok".

Test it out in the game first.

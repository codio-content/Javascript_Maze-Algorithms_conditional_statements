Let's analyse how our `if` statement works.

```javascript
if ( keyCode == 'LEFT' ) {
  player.moveLeft()
} 
```

An `if` statement starts with 

```javascript
if (some condition is true) {
```

You start your line with `if` and then ask the question you are interested in. This is known as a condition and it is enclosed in brackets. At the end of the line, you add a `{`, known as a **curly bracket**. 

**If** this condition is true, then you execute the instructions that come after it, within the `{` `}`.

We're now going to introduce some other very useful tests apart from just `==`.

Here's a table to refer to when we do some challenges in a moment.

| Spoken | Code |
| :- | :- |
| If energy is not equal to 0, show the message "you're still alive" | `if (energy != 0)`|
| If energy is greater than 30, show the message "you've got bags of energy" | `if (energy > 30)`|
| If energy is greater than or equal to 30, show the message "you've got bags of energy" | `if (energy >= 30)` |
| If energy is less than 10, show the message "you're getting low on energy" | `if (energy < 10)` |
| If energy is less than 10, show the message "you're getting low on energy" | `if (energy <= 30)` |

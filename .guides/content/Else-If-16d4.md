`else if` is the final piece of the `if` jigsaw.  What we are doing here is to say 

> - if the right arrow is pressed move right
> - otherwise, if the left arrow is pressed, move left
> - otherwise, display a message.

Notice that the final `else` statement is the catch all when none of the other conditions have been met.

Here's another challenge to make you think.

We want you to write a message saying "You hit : XXXXX" where XXXXX is the thing you hit.

**However** : you are not allowed to use an `if` statement. 

**Hint** : it's actually very easy and involves one line of code and involves a string.

## Solution

```javascript
function collisionEvent(type) {

  showMessage('You hit : ' + type)

}
```
